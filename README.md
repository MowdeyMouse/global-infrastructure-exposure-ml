# global-infrastructure-exposure-ml
This project builds a satellite-based ML system to estimate human infrastructure exposure from public geospatial data. The resulting exposure signal is designed as a reusable foundation for downstream risk modeling tasks including wildfire risk, power outage risk, and climate hazard assessment.
